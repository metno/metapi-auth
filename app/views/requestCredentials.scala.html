  <h1>Request API access</h1>

  <p>You need an API client id to use data.met.no's services. Anyone can get a client id,
  we only ask you to give your email address, so we can contact you in case
  there is a problem with your key. The email address you give here will not
  be used to contact you for any other reasons than key problems.</p>
